# NUS AutoLyrixAlign
Pre-trained model and script to automatically align lyrics to polyphonic audio

## Description
AutoLyrixAlign is a system that automatically provides word-level alignment of a given lyrics text to a given polyphonic music audio file.
This system has been developed by the team from HLT-NUS (Chitralekha Gupta, Emre Yilmaz, Haizhou Li). It has outperformed all other systems in the International Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange platform MIREX 2019.
